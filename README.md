### About Project:

The Snake game built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Canvas is a classic arcade-style game in which the player controls a snake that moves around a game board and eats food pellets to grow longer. The objective of the game is to avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body while collecting as much food as possible. The game is designed with simple graphics and intuitive controls, making it easy for players of all ages to enjoy. The Canvas element of HTML is used to create the game board, while JavaScript is used to handle the game's logic and user input. Overall, the Snake game is a fun and engaging way to pass the time, and a great example of what can be achieved with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Canvas.
